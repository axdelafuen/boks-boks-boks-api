## Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boks-boks-boks/api.git
cd api
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
go mod download
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=boks_db
SECRET_TOKEN=your-secret-jwt-key
```

### 4. Set up PostgreSQL database

Make sure PostgreSQL is running and create the database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE boks_db;
```

The application will automatically run the initialization SQL script on startup.

### 5. Run the development server

```bash
# Format code and run
./build.sh

# Or run directly
go run .
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Production Build

To build for production:

```bash
go build -o main .
./main
```

### Using Docker

The project includes Docker support for easy deployment:

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose (includes PostgreSQL)
docker-compose up --build
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t boks-api .
```

2. Run with environment variables:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e DB_HOST=your_db_host \
  -e DB_USER=your_db_user \
  -e DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password \
  -e DB_NAME=boks_db \
  -e SECRET_TOKEN=your-secret-key \
  boks-api
```

3. Or use Docker Compose for a complete setup:

```bash
